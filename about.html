                <h3>Staying Safe: Avoiding Petty Theft</h3>
                <p>
                    While Taniti is generally a peaceful and welcoming destination, visitors should be aware that petty
                    theft can occasionally occur
                    in crowded or high-traffic areas. We encourage all visitors to follow a few simple precautions to
                    ensure their belongings remain safe:
                </p>
                <ul class="safety-list">
                    <li>Keep personal items close and avoid displaying expensive electronics or jewelry in public.</li>
                    <li>Utilize anti-theft bags or pouches for passports, wallets, and cash, especially in busy public
                        areas like the Taniti City Market and Merriton Landing.</li>
                    <li>Be extra aware in busy public areas such as the Taniti City Market, Merriton Landing
                        Docks, and during large public festivals.</li>
                    <li>Always lock your lodging when leaving and store valuables securely in safes when provided by
                        your accommodation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="final-safety-note">
                    By taking basic precautions, most visitors experience no safety issues and enjoy a secure,
                    stress-free stay.
